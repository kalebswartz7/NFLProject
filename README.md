NFL Personal Project - Accessing an API (Python) 

What this project can do: 
- Access the MySportsFeed API to get all data 
- User can view any NFL team's upcoming 2018 schedule 
- User can view any NFL team's current roster (API will hopefully be updated with post-draft rosters soon) 

Future: 
- Want to give the user the ability to search for players and get their resulting stats 
- Translate program from text-based to a full user interface (WebApp?)
- More :)
